    <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
    <p>
      The contents of this app were created with great care. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy,
      completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider I am responsible for my own content
      on these pages under general laws (§ 7 Abs.1 TMG). According to §§ 8–10 TMG I am not obligated to
      monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating
      illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain
      unaffected. Liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific
      infringement. Upon becoming aware of such violations, I will remove the content immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
    <p>
      This app may contain links to external websites. I have no influence on their content and therefore
      cannot assume any liability for them. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always
      responsible for the content of linked pages. If I become aware of legal violations, such links will be
      removed immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>
      Content and works created by the app operator are subject to German copyright law. Duplication,
      processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization beyond copyright limits requires prior
      written consent. Downloads and copies are only permitted for private, non-commercial use unless
      expressly stated otherwise. Insofar as the content was not created by me, third-party copyrights are
      respected. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me so I
      can remove the content promptly.
