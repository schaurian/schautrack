    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose and legal bases (Art. 6 GDPR)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provide the service</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)): account creation, login, storing your entries and settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Security and abuse prevention</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)): protect Schautrack accounts, detect misuse, maintain reliability.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)): comply with statutory requirements (e.g., security logging).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)) where explicitly requested (e.g., optional features you enable). You can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use only essential cookies for session management and security. No tracking or advertising cookies are set.
      If you block essential cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use the service.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage duration</h2>
    <p>
      We store your data while you have a Schautrack account. If you delete your account, related personal data is removed
      or anonymized unless legal retention duties require longer storage (e.g., security logs for a limited time).
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal data. Data is shared only with service providers necessary to operate Schautrack
      (e.g., hosting/database) under confidentiality and data processing agreements, or where required by law.
      No advertising or third-party tracking providers are used.
    </p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Hosting or processors may be located outside your country. Appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual
      clauses) are used where required.
    </p>

    <h2>Deletion and export</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete your account (and personal data stored with it) anytime via Settings → Delete account, or
      request deletion by following the steps on the <a href="/delete">deletion page</a>. You can export your data
      via Settings → Backup &amp; restore.
    </p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      You have the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection where the
      legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f). You may withdraw consent at any time. To exercise these rights, contact
      via the contact above. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority
      (e.g., Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht).
    </p>
