    <p>
      We use technical and organizational safeguards such as encryption in transit, hashed passwords, access controls,

      suspected unauthorized use.

      applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Third Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>
      The App may link to third party services or include content provided by others. Those services are governed

      their policies before engaging with them.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We may use cookies, device identifiers, and local storage to keep you signed in, maintain session security,
      remember preferences, and analyze usage. You can control cookies through your device settings, but some
      features may not function properly if disabled.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Data Minimization and Design</h2>
    <p>
      We intentionally collect only the data required to deliver the service and design features to process data
      on device when possible. We regularly review collection practices to align with this principle and update
      retention settings to remove stale data.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
